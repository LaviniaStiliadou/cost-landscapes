# Experiment Implementations

This folder contains the implementations used for our experiment, which involved the evaluation of various metrics using Python and MATLAB. Below, we provide details on where to find specific code related to the experiment.

## Evaluation Languages
For the evaluation of our experiment, we utilized two programming languages:

- **Python:** Python was used for various aspects of the experiment, including the evaluation of the total variation and fourier density.

- **MATLAB:** MATLAB was employed for specific computations and analysis related to our research.

## Code References
To access the code implementations for the Total Variation (TV) and Fourier Density (FD) metrics, please refer to the following code files or directories:

- [TV & FD](https://github.com/Boniface316/qaoa_landscape)

For the evaluation of the Inverse Gradient Standard Deviation (IGSD) and Scalar Curvature metrics, please look at the corresponding code files:

- [IGSD](igsd.m)
- [Scalar curvature](scalarCurvature.m)

These code implementations are essential for replicating our experiment and understanding the details of the metrics we applied. If you have any questions or need further clarification regarding the code or its usage, please do not hesitate to contact our team.
